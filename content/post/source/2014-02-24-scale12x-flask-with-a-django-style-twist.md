Django is great if you like the ORM, relational databases, and serving public facing websites. If you don’t intend to stray too far from the built-ins; keep Django, otherwise you should consider Flask. Flask is a flexible micro-framework with no enforced ORM so you can incorporate your own ORM, OGM, or unique object manager. If you still like the syntactic sugar and organization of Django, don’t fear, you can keep it with just a little bit of work. Here I’ll show you how to make Flask act similar to Django for serving up an API.
